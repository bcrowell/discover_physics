Discover Physics
================

Discover Physics is a conceptual physics textbook intended for students in a nonmathematical one-semester general-education course. The new version of Discover Physics is Conceptual Physics. I'm no longer actively maintaining Discover Physics, and I recommend that new adopters use Conceptual Physics instead. 

The book's web page is
